Q) what is uni-directional and bi-directional in Hibernate ?
A) if we have 2 tables and 1 table act as primary key and other tables act as foreign key.
i.e mapping is done in only 1 table. (only 1 table is depend on other table) is called uni-directional.

-> if we have 2 tables and both tables act as primary key and foreign key.
i.e mapping is done on both tables (both table depend on each other) is called bi-directional.

Q) What is Bi-directional Association ?
A) Bidirectional association allows us to fetch details of dependent object from both side. In such case, we have the reference of two classes in each other.
-> Let's take an example of Employee and Address, if Employee class has-a reference of Address and Address has a reference of Employee. Additionally, you have applied one-to-one or one-to-many relationship for the classes in mapping file as well, it is known as bidirectional association.

Q) What is mappedBy property ?
A) While performing Bi-Directional mapping between 2 hibernate classes, we will need to explicitly tell to hibernate which side it should consider for performing mapping task using mappedBy property. The side which we want to consider for performing mapping task in general known as "Owning Side" and the other side is known as "Non-Owning side".
-> The side where you mention mappedBy becomes "Non-Owning side".
-> If we want hibernate to do the mapping task just once, then we explicitly tell to hibernate using mappedBy property. so that hibernate wont include 3rd table for mapping task.
-> The mappedBy attribute tells that the @ManyToOne side is in charge of managing the Foreign Key column, and the collection is used only to fetch the child entities and to cascade parent entity state changes to children (e.g., removing the parent should also remove the child entities).

Q) Hibernate Lifecycle
A) The Hibernate lifecycle contains 3 states, "Transient", "Persistent" and "Detached" State.

i) Transient state:-
--------------------
-> The transient state is the initial state of an object.
-> Once we create an instance of POJO class, then the object entered in the transient state.
-> Here, an object is not associated with the Session. So, the transient state is not related to any database.
-> Hence, modifications in the data don't affect any changes in the database.
-> The transient objects exist in the heap memory. They are independent of Hibernate.

ex:-
---
Employee e=new Employee(); //Here, object enters in the transient state.  
e.setId(101);  
e.setFirstName("Gaurav");  
e.setLastName("Chawla");  

ii) Persistent state:- 
----------------------
-> As soon as the object associated with the Session, it entered in the persistent state.
-> Hence, we can say that an object is in the persistence state when we save or persist it.
-> Here, each object represents the row of the database table.
-> So, modifications in the data make changes in the database.

We can use any of the following methods for the persistent state,
session.save(e), session.persist(e), session.update(e), session.saveOrUpdate(e) etc..

iii) Detached state:-
---------------------
-> Once we either close the session or clear its cache, then the object entered into the detached state.
-> As an object is no more associated with the Session, modifications in the data don't affect any changes in the database.
-> However, the detached object still has a representation in the database.
-> If we want to persist the changes made to a detached object, it is required to reattach the application to a valid Hibernate session.

Note:- To associate the detached object with the new hibernate session, use any of these methods - load(), merge(), refresh(), update() or save() on a new session with the reference of the detached object.

We can use any of the following methods for the detached state.
session.close(), session.clear(), session.detach(e), session.evict(e)

Q) Difference between clear(), evict() and close() in hibernate
A) Clear() :- When this method get called inside transaction boundry then all objects which are currently associate with particular session will be  disconnected / clean or no longer associate with that Session instance.
-> Therefore, after calling this method nothing will be performed on persistance layer or DB.

evict():- To detach the object from session cache, hibernate provides evict() method. After detaching the object from the session, any change to object will not be persisted.

Close():- Close session by calling session.close() method, means End the session and releasing the JDBC Connection and clean up.

Q) What are the types of Fetch Type
A) There are 2 types of Fetch type. Lazy and Eager Fetch type.

a) Eager Fetch type (or) Eager Loading:- Associated Data loads along with Actual data.
b) Lazy Fetch type (or) Lazy Loading:- Associated Data loads only when we explicitly call getter method of Associated data.

Ex:- 
----
Question q = (Question)s.get(Question.class, 1212);
System.out.println(q.getQuestionId());
System.out.println(q.getQuestion);

System.out.println(q.getAnswers().size());

Note:- For above example, if we define our class as Lazy Loading, hibernate will run 2 queries. 1st query to get only Questions Data and 2nd query to get Associated Data (On Demand).
-> For 1st 2 statements, Answers class or Associated data wont get loaded as we have defined Lazy Loading(if we wont write 3rd statement).

Q) What is Transaction in hibernate
A) we can use Transaction when we save or update the data (or) any changes in table.
ex:- Transaction tx = s.beginTransaction();

Q) What is cascade in hibernate
A) cascade is to perform operations on related entities of associated entities.
If we take Question and Answers as 2 entities or 2 Object classes which performs "@OnetoMany" Relationship. Answers class is acting as associated class cos Answers id is a foreignkey in Questions class, like below source code,

class Question {

	private int id;

	@OnetoMany(fetch = FetchType.Lazy,cascade = CascadeType.All)
	private List<Answers> answers;
	
}

class Answers{
	private int id;
}

-> if we want to perform save or persist operation on above 2 classes, if we have not defined any cascadeType as "persist", then we have to call save() explicitly for Question and Answers Object.
ex:-
----
Question q1 = new Question();
q1.questionId(123);
q1.setQuestion("What is Cascading Type...");

s.save(q1);
s.save(a1);
s.save(a2);

-> By above example, we need to perform multiple save operations to save 2 Entities though they are performing relationship.
-> But if we define "cascade = CascadeType.Persist" on like above class, we dont have to perform multiple save operations. on single save, it will save for both Entities.
ex:- s.save(q1); // q1 also includes data of Answers class.

Note:- By above example, we are saving only "q1" because we have performed "cascade = "CascadeType.Persist", which automatically saves dat for Associate class as well while performing only single save operation "s.save(q1)". No need to call other/extra "save(a1)".

Q) Types of Cascade in Hibernate
A) ALL, Persist, Detach, Merge, Remove and Refresh.

Q) Difference between Persist and Save method
A) -> Persist() return nothing because it is void whereas save() methods Serializable Object as return Type which returns Identifier(generated id value or primiray key).
-> Persist() can be used only inside/within the boundary of a transaction whereas save() can be used inside or outside the transaction boundary.
-> Persist() takes less time to execute as it does not return anything whereas save() takes more time because once the object is saved, it returns the identifier back from that save().
-> Persist() need to initialize transaction boundary to perform operation whereas we dont even need to initialize transaction boundary while save().

ex for persist():-
------------------
session.beginTransaction();
session.persist(employee);
session.getTransaction().commit();

ex for save():-
---------------
session.save(employee);

-> By above 2 Examples, if we perform persist() outside of transaction boundary, it wont save any data in db and wont get any Exception since its return types is void.
-> By performing save(), we can perform outside of transaction boundary or we dont even have to initialize transaction boundary.

Note:- When we create any object for Employee class and set properties using set(), at that point our Entity is in Transient state. To save the transient data in DB we use persist(). Transient state is not mapped with any DB record.

Q) Difference between get() and Load() in hibernate
A) -> get() gives the Object whereas load() does not gives you any Object. (Only gives proxy/blank/fake Object if you use it).
-> get() gives you null if it doesnt find any identifier whereas load() will fire ObjectNotFoundException if identifier is not found. 
-> get() will hit the DB everytime will call whereas load() dont hit the DB (or) wont fire the query unless you use the Object. below example
Ex:-
----
Question q1 = session.load(Question.class,123);
System.out.println(q1);

Note:- if we use load() like above example, it wont hit the DB (or) wont fire the query. It will only fire if we use 2nd line statement if we use load() call.

Q) Difference between merge() and update() in hibernate
A) -> In Update(), the Employee object needs to be created under session, and same object refernce we need to use to perform update() operation where as in merge() we can create the object outside of the session, and same object we can use to save changes by creating another session.
-> update() will only work under session and on persistant object, whereas we can use merge() on transient object under another session with same identifier.

Ex:-
---
Employee employee = null
try(Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();){
	employee = session.get(Employee.class,1); // persistant Object
} catch(Exception e){
	e.printStackTrace();
}

employee.setEmail("pk.m@gmail.com"); // Transient Object since Session is closed

try(Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();){
	Employee employee = session.get(Employee.class,1);
	session.beginTransaction();
	session.update(employee);  // NonUniqueObjectException. since we are performing operation on same identifier i.e. session.get(Employee.class,1); and using 2 different sessions
	session.merge(employee);  // works fine
	session.getTransaction().commit(); 
} catch(Exception e){
	e.printStackTrace();
}

Note:- As above Example, we are using same Employee object in 2nd/other session because we want transient object which was loaded in 1st session and now this 1st session is closed but still want to perform modification on this transient object to sync the data, then we can use merge() by using another session.
-> if we want to modify any transient object and then load same object in different session, to update this modified data on transient object, we can use merge().

Q) what is Refresh() in hibernate
A) To get or pull the latest DB data we use refresh() under session. ex:- session.refresh();

Q) Difference between primary and unique key
A) The primary key is accepted as a unique or sole identifier for every record in the table. In the case of a primary key, we cannot save NULL values. 
   In the case of a unique key, we can save a null value, however, only one NULL value is supported. It supports entity integrity.
